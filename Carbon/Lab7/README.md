# Lab 7 - Carbon

I decided to do the Powershell Module Carbon for Lab 7 and what the Module Carbon does is automate processes that are not included in the regular version of Powershell and will make System Administrators daily jobs much easier.

# Install


```javascript

Install-Module -Name 'Carbon' -AllowClobber
Import-Module 'Carbon'
```
